# Natural Language Processing Labs – Big Data Analytics
This repository contains a collection of five NLP labs completed during my Master of Science in Big Data Analytics at Al Akhawayn University, Morocco.
The labs progressively cover the full spectrum of NLP, from text preprocessing and classic ML models to deep learning architectures and advanced linguistic tasks.
