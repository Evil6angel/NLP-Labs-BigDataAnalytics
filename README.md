# Natural Language Processing Labs â€“ MS Big Data Analytics
This repository contains a series of five NLP labs completed as part of the Natural Language Processing course in the Master of Science in Big Data Analytics program at Al Akhawayn University.
The labs cover core NLP concepts, from preprocessing to advanced transformer-based architectures.

## Lab Overview
### Lab 01 â€“ Preprocessing and N-grams
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization
- Statistical language models: unigram, bigram, trigram generation and probability estimation

### Lab 02 â€“ NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Word Vector Semantics
- Document classification with NaÃ¯ve Bayes & Logistic Regression
- Semantic similarity using Word2Vec embeddings

### Lab 03 â€“ RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers
- Sequence modeling with RNNs and LSTMs
- Introduction to attention mechanisms and transformer models

### Lab 04 â€“ Machine Translation, POS Tagging, and Named Entity Recognition
- Neural machine translation (seq2seq)
- POS tagging and NER using spaCy and transformer-based models

### Lab 05 â€“ Coreference Resolution
- Coreference detection and resolution in text
- Analysis of entity linking in long-form documents

## Tech Stack: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, Gensim, spaCy, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

ðŸ“Œ These labs demonstrate hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating NLP models, as well as applying them to real-world linguistic tasks.
