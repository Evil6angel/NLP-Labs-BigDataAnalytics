# Lab 05 â€“ Coreference Resolution

- Implemented coreference resolution on sample and custom texts using NeuralCoref integrated with spaCy.
- Identified coreference clusters (e.g., pronouns linked to named entities) and replaced pronouns with resolved references.
- Compared coreference outputs on formal vs. informal text and documented failure cases.
